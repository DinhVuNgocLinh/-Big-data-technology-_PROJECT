## Overview
This project explores customer purchasing behavior in an online retail dataset using big data tools such as **PySpark**, **Streamlit**, and **clustering algorithms**. The aim is to help businesses understand their customers, detect churn, and segment them for better marketing strategies.

## Team Members

* Pham Vu Tuyet Anh
* Dinh Thi Thanh Hang
* Le Thi Tuyet My
* Dinh Vu Ngoc Linh
## Tools & Technologies

* **PySpark** for distributed data preprocessing, RFM feature engineering, churn labeling, and K-Means clustering
* **Streamlit** to build an interactive dashboard for visualizing retail data insights
* **Pandas**, **Plotly**, **Matplotlib** for additional analysis and plotting

## Key Features

* Cleaned and preprocessed real-world retail data (handling missing values, duplicates, invalid transactions)
* Applied **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis to understand customer value
* Created a churn label based on recency and frequency thresholds
* Used **K-Means** clustering to segment customers into behavioral groups
* Developed a **Streamlit dashboard** to explore data, view churn rates, and analyze customer segments
